\section{Windfarm problem setting}
  \paragraph{}
    Several maintenance jobs specific to windfarm are to be carried out while minimizing costs. 
    Costs are broken down to material and staff related components. Each maintenance job 
    requires staff with different expertise and each job can be normal or severe maintenance 
    that requires deeper knowledge from the staff to resolve. The staff also has an attribute 
    called experience points or job expertise that can be junior/middle/senior the higher 
    the level of experience the more XP is related but also higher staff costs are associated.

    \subsection{Maintenance jobs}
      Maintenance jobs are divided into 5 types based on which expertise is required from the staff. 
      Each of the 5 maintenance types are further grouped based on severity. Level of severity 
      determines the XPs required from the staff to accomplish such task. Currently only 
      2 severity levels have been set for each task types, "normal" stands for regular task 
      and "severe" stands for more difficult operations with higher required XP.

    \subsection{Staff}
      Staff is divided into 4 types: electrician is taking care of wiring and electrical repairs, 
      mechanic is tasked with assembling/disassembling stuffs, storage workers are keeping 
      the warehouse tidy and in order while software engineers are responsible for 
      programming controlling software and calibrating the elements. Staff is also described by 
      level of expertise, there are 3 categories with different experience points: junior, middle, senior.

    \subsection{Sets}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item set MaintenanceTypes \{blades, gearbox, generator, sensors, wiring\}
        \item set MaintenanceSeverity \{normal, severe\}
        \item set StaffTypes \{electric, mechanic, storage, software\}
        \item set StaffLevels \{junior, middle, senior\}
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Parameters}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item param main\_req \{MaintenanceTypes, MaintenanceSeverity\}: cnt of maintenance required
        \item param main\_req\_st\{MaintenanceTypes,StaffTypes\}: cnt of staff required per maintenance type and staff category
        \item param main\_req\_xp\{MaintenanceTypes,MaintenanceSeverity\}: required XP for maintenance task based on severity
        \item param main\_material\_cost\{MaintenanceTypes\}: material cost of maintenance tasks
        \item param staff\_level\_xp\{StaffLevels\}: staff level XPs
        \item param staff\_cost\{StaffTypes,StaffLevels\}: staff cost per type and level
        \item param main\_burnout: weight based on severity of maintenance task
        \item param burnout\_coef: total (severity weighted) tasks / staff cutoff
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Variables}
      \subsubsection{Variables used by solver}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item var staff\_to\_hire\{StaffTypes, StaffLevels\}: cnt of staff needed as per type and level
          \item var quantity\{MaintenanceTypes\}: cnt maintenance tasks to be carried out
        \end{itemize}

      \subsubsection{Redundant variables - improve readability}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item var total\_main\_req\_xp\{MaintenanceTypes\}: required XP points to carry out maintenance task
          \item var total\_staff\_xp\{StaffTypes\}: total available XP per staff types of hired personnel
          \item var total\_staff\{StaffTypes\}: total cnt of hired personnel
          \item var total\_staff\_xp\_task\{MaintenanceTypes\}: XP of hired personnel per category required for maintenance task
          \item var weighted\_maintenance\_tasks\{MaintenanceTypes\}: nr of maintenance tasks weighted by burnout factor
          \item var total\_req\_wgt\_staff\{StaffTypes\}: total cnt of required staff for maintenance tasks weighted by severity
        \end{itemize}
        
    \subsection{Conditions}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{XP condition:} sufficient XP points to carry out upcoming maintenance tasks based on severity. 
        It is only required to have enough XPs to carry out at least one of all types of maintenance task 
        (based on severity), e.g. maintenance task "blades" normally requires 10 XPs whereas severe 
        requires 80 XPs but when no severe maintenance task is scheduled for "blades" (main\_req parameter 
        is set to 0) then the condition prescribes 10 XPs for this maintenance task (normal severity level).
        It does not matter how many maintenance jobs are expected, the hired staff has to have 
        enough XPs to do all types of jobs. E.g. if normal maintenance task "blades" is expected 
        12 times and no severe "blades" task required, then XPs of hired personnel has to have at least 
        10 XPs (normal "blade" maintenance XP) and not 12 times 10 XPs. It will just take them more time 
        to do all 12 normal "blades" job.
        \item \textit{Staff condition:} number of staff for a given type (no matter if junior/middle/senior) 
        covers the required number of staff for each maintenance task. E.g. in order to be able carry 
        out maintenance task "blades", main\_req\_st\{MaintenanceType,StaffType\} prescribes 3 mechanics 
        and 4 storage personnel so at least 3 mechanics and 4 storage workers have to be hired.
        \item \textit{Minimum maintenance:} maintenance jobs defined in main\_req are carried out.
        \item \textit{Burnout indicator:} staff is not overloaded meaning that the severity weighted number 
        of maintenance tasks per staff member has to be lower than the parameter burnout\_coef.
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Objectives}
    Minimize total costs given by the aggregated sum of main\_material\_cost and staff\_cost given 
    the above conditions.
